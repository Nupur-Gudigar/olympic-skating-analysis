    "\n",
    "I spent way too long looking for a ready-made dataset on Kaggle before accepting that it simply didn't exist. Figure skating is a niche sport, and nobody had put together a clean dataset with both TES (technical) and PCS (artistic) component scores for Olympic singles skating across multiple years. So I did what any slightly obsessed person would do — I built it myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes straight from **[ISU](https://www.isuresults.com/results/season2526/owg2026/)** — the International Skating Union, the governing body of figure skating. They have a complete archive of competition results on their website, broken down by segment, score, and component. It's all there, it just wasn't in a CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did try web scraping first. Keyword: *tried*. It was taking longer to figure out than just... opening the pages and building the dataset manually. I'll figure out web scraping. One day. 😅\n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up building two CSV files with different levels of granularity`[used Excel for this]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. `olympics_singles_long`** — one row per skater per segment (SP and FS separately)\n",
    "`[year, gender, segement, rank, skater, nation, tss, tes, pcs, ded]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. `olympics_singles_agg`** — one row per skater per Olympics, with everything aggregated\n",
    "`[year, gender, final_rank, skater, nation, total_tss, sp_rank, fs_rank, tss_sp, tes_sp, pcs_sp, tss_fs,tes_fs, pcs_fs, tes_total, pcs_total, tech_dominance, medal]`\n",
    "\n",
    "And honestly? I'm thinking of publishing this on Kaggle once the project is done — because if I had to build it from scratch, someone else probably struggled to find it too. Figure skating deserves better dataset representation. Consider this my contribution. 🛹\n",

    "## 🔍 Loading & Validating the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before any analysis, we load both CSVs and immediately run a quick audit — shapes, column names, data types, missing values, duplicate rows. Just because the data was built manually doesn't mean nothing snuck through, and these checks are what save you two hours of debugging later when a chart looks wrong and you can't figure out why.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧮 The Metric That Runs This Entire Analysis: `tech_dominance`\n",
    "\n",
    "TES and PCS are raw scores, and raw scores shift across eras — a TES of 90 meant something very different in 2006 than in 2026 as jump difficulty, scoring standards, and judging calibration have all evolved. Comparing them directly across years would be comparing apples to oranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of asking *\"how high was the TES?\"*, we ask: `**\"what share of the total score came from technique?\"**`\n",
    "```\n",
    "tech_dominance = TES / (TES + PCS)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a ratio between 0 and 1 — always relative, always era-neutral. A value of **0.53** means 53% of the score came from technical elements and 47% from artistry, regardless of whether the total was 200 or 300.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the spine of the analysis because our central question is `*\"does technique win medals over artistry?\"*` — and `tech_dominance` is literally the numerical form of that question. TES and PCS alone can't answer it: a skater with TES 80/PCS 70 wins *differently* than one with TES 100/PCS 90, even though the second has higher raw scores on both. The ratio cuts through that and captures something about *how* a skater wins, not just whether they win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important check in this first cell is cross-validating this column — recomputing `tech_dominance` from raw TES and PCS and comparing it against the Excel-derived value. If they match, we proceed. If not, we fix it before touching anything else."
